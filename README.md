# Rukt
Rukt is a work-in-progress library designed to lay out and constrain objects using lists of predicates. Because it has no dependencies and has a tiny footprint, it's perfect for embedding into a larger library.

The primary use case envisioned for Rukt is as the box layout engine for a UI engine.

See `main.lua` for the current demo.

## Design
The Rukt model is based entirely on function composition representing a graph. I'll eventually be able to explain this more clearly.

## License
Rukt is available under the MIT license. See `LICENSE.md` for more details.
